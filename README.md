## About

### OSL Data Collaboratory
This project is part of the Open Spatial Lab's 2023 Data Collaboratory. The Collaboratory is a 6-month program where OSL engages with social impact organizations to build a customized tool for data management, analysis, communication, and visualization. Circulate San Diegoâ€™s organizational engagement and feedback directly informs this work. 

Based at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute, the Open Spatial Lab creates open source data tools and analytics to solve problems using geospatial data science. Read more about OSL at https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/open-spatial-lab/. 

### Project Scope
**About**: Californians for Pesticide Reform (CPR) is a statewide coalition of more than 190 organizations that was founded in 1996 to fundamentally shift the way pesticides are used in California.  

**Project**: OSL worked with CPR to develop a new data tool to track and visualize pesticide use across the state of California at multiple spatial scales, including neighborhoods, school districts and counties. This project leverages publicly available pesticide use data to deliver a tracking tool that remains sustainable and stable online, and transparent to update and maintain by CPR and its coalition partners.
