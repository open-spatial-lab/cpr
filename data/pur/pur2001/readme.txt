Detailed data on the structure of the pesticide use data and lookup tables is in the
CDROM file: cd_doc.pdf. Starting with the 2001 PUR, only a text version of the database is available in comma delimited format.
This format should be easily importable into most databases including GIS. In addition to the text CDROM,
a separate CDROM with spatial data is needed for GIS applications. This CDROM is available from DPR.

A diagram depicting the relationships between the Use Data Chemical table and the cross-reference (lookup) tables
has been included on the CDROM (diagram.pdf).  The diagram can also be found in the CD documentation file (CD_doc.pdf).
